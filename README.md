# About Project

The following project was created by me while learning about asynchronous programming in Dart. I learnt to carry out time consuming tasks such as getting device location and networking to get data from the internet. I made a weather app inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Olia Gozha](https://dribbble.com/shots/4663154-). The app helps you to be able to find out the live weather data in the current location of the device as well as the weather for any city one wish to look for!
